            description: "Top Stories picked for you and recommendations from Siri.",
            image: UIImage(systemName: "heart.fill")!

    ],
    action: OnboardingAction(
        title: "Agree and Continue",
        handler: { action in
            // Do something, such as storing flag in `UserDefaults`.
