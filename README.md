## Usage

Use *Single Page Onboarding View Controller* to configure single page onboarding content. After configuring the single page onboarding controller with the feature items and action, present it using the `present(_:animated:completion:)` method. UIKit displays onboarding content modaly over your app's content.

```swift
let onboarding = SinglePageOnboardingController(
    title: "Welcome to My App!",
    featureItems: [
        OnboadingFeatureItem(
            title: "More Personalized",
            description: "Top Stories picked for you and recommendations from Siri.",
            image: UIImage(systemName: "heart.fill")!
        )
    ],
)

onboarding.action = OnboardingAction(
        title: "Agree and Continue",
        handler: { action in
            onboarding.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
        }
)

self.present(onboarding, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
